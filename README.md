# Solving the advent of code puzzles in haskell

- This repo contains my solutions to the advent of code puzzles for 2021.
- What is advent of code? --> [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

# Approach
- Get two stars at each solution, don't ask for help/advice.
- Check other haskell solutions after having finished a task and compare them
  (if there is enough time).

# Build
- If not already installed, get the haskell toolchain installer [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) and install cabal. Then run `cabal update` once.
- Run `cabal build` to build the executables for all days.
- Run `cabal build DayXX` to build the executable for a given day.
- Run `cabal run DayXX` to build (if not available) and run the executable for a
  given day.

# Notes
- This is a step in my journy to learning and becoming decent in haskell. I did
  first start exploring the language this year by going through the book "Learn
You A Haskell" to grasp basic concepts and am quite fascinated by it since then.
- Doing first 14 days because of time constraints. Might do more, but highly
  unlikely.
